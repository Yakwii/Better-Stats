# Better Stats
A C# library for stats. This library is my therapy from that one time a dude reviewed my code and got upset that I used implicit operators "too much". The pain of being told not to do something casued me to spriral out of control and create a namespace dedicated to the concept. Tho, partly true, I have noticed that through all of the RPG tutorials that I've watched, they'll don't do stat's like this. I've seen a couple create a separate struct instead of just using an int or float(I hope nobody uses a floatðŸ˜¬for stats), but never set the struct up as a conversion.

So, I don't care what you do with it. pretty simple.
